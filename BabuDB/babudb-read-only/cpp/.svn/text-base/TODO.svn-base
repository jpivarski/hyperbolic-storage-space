== General
- implement multi-value keys (needs Remove(key, value))
- get rid of LogStats

== ImmutableIndex
- change format from current set of key records to single record with (relative) offset array (saves record frames)
- add gap compression for keys
- add entropy compression for values

== LogIndex
- Put keys in tree nodes (better cache locality)

== Log
- remove LSN support in the log (should be done at user-level)
